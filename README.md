# SecureDB
Ever wanted a "secure" database? Well, we've got you covered! We use SHA-256 encryption in a one-time password (OTP) request. That means that the encrypted password will be added in a text file once they expire, and won't be able to be used again.

To use, run `git clone https://github.com/LoganPaxton/SecureDB`. Currently it is only avaliable to Python users. Once you to that, run `chmod +x api.sh && ./api.sh` this will run the Python file in the "cli" folder.

### Update Logs
V1.1 ~ Added API keys  
V1.2 ~ Added API key generation, and fixed sign in.
